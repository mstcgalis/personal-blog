title: The Millionaire Next Door
author: Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko
review: I was expecting this to be one of those scammy books on manifesting wealth that tries to sell you a program, and was delighted to find that it was the exact opposite. It's one of the most realistic books on building wealth, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in personal finance.

If I had count on my fingers - how many times I've started a blog, programmed and published it, and then without posting anything, thrown it away - one hand wouldn't be enough.

This time, however, I'm trying a slightly different approach. I don't put great expectations on myself and I see the blog as a work in progress. I'll just write - whether it's just short notes, longer explorations, or some useful tutorials – and what (if anything) will come out of it, time will tell.

And I think that for it to work in the long run, it should serve me first and foremost. In short, accept that no one is ever likely to read it and yet it makes sense to write something.

I started keeping a journal after being on such a retreat away from people and for the first time I managed to keep it up for several days in a row, so I would like to continue. So far I've been sharing it on are.na, but it'll be nicer to read it here.
