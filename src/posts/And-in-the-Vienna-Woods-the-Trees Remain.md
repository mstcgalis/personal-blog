The book is told through letters exchanged between a Jewish boy who had to flee from the war from Austria to Sweden and his parents, who were not allowed to leave.

I was interested in the book because during his stay this Jewish boy became friends with the later founder of Ikea - Ingvar Kampard. And they became friends even though Ingvar is a great enthusiast of right-wing politics and Nazism. 

Unfortunately, only a fraction of the book is devoted to the relationship between these guys, so I was a bit disappointed. 

Not that the correspondence between the boy and his family is not interesting, but as a person living in central Europe, where these events took place, I have feeling that I've heard a similar story many times before.
