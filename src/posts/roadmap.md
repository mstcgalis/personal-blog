As you can see, there is not much here yet. I wanted to publish the page in the first place and let it grow and shape it in time.
In this post, I would like to describe what my plans with this site are.

For now, there are two categories on the main page - writing and reading: 

Writing will be the place where I add written material as the name suggests... it will range from random entries, diaries and complex articles to tutorials and observations. These will be tagged so they can be filtered in the future (I disabled this function for now because with two posts filtering doesn't make much sense).

Reading will be for recording books or articles that I am currently reading and for reviewing those that I've already read.

In the future, I will add categories like watching, listening, and working out. Their content you can probably guess.

I have yet to decide how stupid I want this site to be. The option is to fetch the data from external sources like goodreads, letterbox, spotify, strava, etc. or enter the data manually.

I guess it makes sense for me to fetch the data that is collected automatically, like the stuff I'm listening to on spotify into the listenting section, but for the stuff I'm already entering somewhere, I don't mind writing it here as well. 

## To Do's

- create templates for all the content types
- add some basic navigation like back button from post back to homepage
- tune the styling so every conent type is covered (codeblock, images, videos, etc.)
- add subscribe button
