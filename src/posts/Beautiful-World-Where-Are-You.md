For people who read novels often, the name Sally Roony needs no introduction. I'm just starting out with this type of book, so I couldn't help but choose an author who is peeking out at me from all sides. 

I've always considered myself a slow reader, but I devoured this book in less than a week. 

The interesting thing about it is that there's actually nothing interesting about it. The book tells the story of 4 people who live their lives together, which occasionally intertwine.

I liked the way the story was told - the descriptive chapter was always followed by a chapter where the two main characters have an email exchange and describe feelings and deeper meanings related to events that happened in the previous chapter. Through these e-mails, more human-like and alive thoughts and probably even some of the worldview of the author herself come to light. 

I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to start reading novels and is looking for something easy to get started.
