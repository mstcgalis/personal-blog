Can tracking become an exciting and creative practice instead of a boring chore? As a part of my [A TOOL A WEEK](https://www.are.na/prompt-club/a-tool-a-week-fvp2owopmqi) commitment, I worked on a better habit-tracking method, that anyone could potentially modify and use on their journey. After a week of ideation, research, sketching, prototyping and a round of feedback from designer friends, I created a customisable system called **Ritual Sketching**.

First some definitions:

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit):
> A **habit**  is a routine of behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.

For the sake of this tool, I will define **ritual** as a positive habit being built intentionally and performed mindfully. Beyond repetition, rituals can provide a way to structure time and direct one's attention to meaningful pursuits.

Like many others, I have been slowly trying to build everyday habits since reading James Clear's amazing Atomic Habits. One of the techniques he recommends is "habit tracking" - keeping a record of how consistently you are performing certain activities, hence turning them into habits. You can read about the benefits of tracking in this [summary](https://www.are.na/block/14441936).

# My experience with habit tracking
![[table tracker.png|350]]
For a total time of about 2 months, I've used an analogue tracker in the form of a spreadsheet printed on an A4. Here are my thoughts:

**The Good**
- analogue tracking is very satisfying
- hanging on the wall next to my table creates a physical presence in my environment, which is very powerful

**The bad**
- tracking only a boolean value is reductive
- leads to performing a habit for the sake of the tracker, not for its own sake
- analogue is not practical for travelling
- placement on the wall is not practical for moving about

**The ugly**
I'm not saying spreadsheets aren't beautiful, but the look quickly became stale and office-like. This is exactly the vibe I want to steer away from.

# The Ritual Sketching method
The goal of **Ritual Sketching** is to keep a record of your habits with compounding, generative compositions. Instead of ticking a checkbox, the person using this method will create a sketch in their **log** according to a predetermined **key**. This sketch should reflect their habits on a particular day.

The **key** pairs each habit with a thing to draw. For example, my current key looks like this:
```key
PERFORM   :   DRAW
meditate  :   line
mantra    :   ellipse
excersize :   polygon
read      :   rectangle
write     :   squiggle
design    :   star
code      :   dots
````

In the **log**, each day should have its section with a **star(t)** placed in the middle of that section. The **star(t)** defines the x and the y axes, providing an "artificial" anchor on which the "natural" sketching can take place. Digital example: 
![[Screenshot 2023-03-20 at 12.42.04.png|500]]

When a person performs a certain habit, they draw the corresponding thing into today's section of the **log**. This continues throughout the day as the shapes slowly compound into a composition. A the end of the day a sketch containing information on today's activities emerges. Even though the **key** stays the same, each daily sketch will inevitably be unique. Seeing the effort already put in, the daily **log** should act as a source of motivation, as breaking the chain with an empty **star(t)** will not feel right. After some time has passed, changes, fluctuations, exceptions and maybe even trends can be observed.

With sketching, there's a lot of opportunity for non-boolean reflectivity. Some simple ideas to start with: 
- the size of the shape reflects the length of the ritual
- the placement of the shape reflects the time of day the ritual was performed
# My implementation (templates included)
**Ritual Sketching** as a system and practice can be implemented in many different forms. Here I will provide my implementation(s) along with a blank template to get you started!

I use an analogue tracker printed on an A4 which I hang next to my desk. One sheet contains 5 rows of 7 **start(s)** for a total of 35 days, which is more than enough for a month's worth of sketching. The key is printed at the top along with a space to fill out the *start* and *end* dates.

**Templates** (as ordered in the PDF):
- the exact one I use
- fully blank
- blank rituals + "shapes" key
- blank rituals + "abstract" key
- blank rituals + "object" key

# Final thoughts
I'm looking forward to using this technique in the coming months, as only time will tell how well it truly works. Then there's an exciting idea I got from my friends - to implement **Ritual Sketching** in a paper notebook or some kind of digital space, both of which will provide an affordance to "animate" individual sketches into a moving picture. I'll post an update once I gather more experiences, thoughts and prototypes. Thanks for reading!
